      <p>Welcome to my BIO site! </p>
      <p>My name is Hitomi. I was working for IT companies after graduating collage as COBOL programer and IT technical engineer for EBS Financial applications. </p>
      <p>In 2014 I was offerred the chance for an internal transfer with my global company and took this opportunity to move to the US from Japan.</p>
      <p>I was a Oracle Customer Support Technical Engineer for Oracle EBS (All Financial Products) for 9.5 years in total after being a COBOL Programmer for 3 years.</p> 
      <p>Then I worked as a System Engineer for 4 years in SIers working on EBS Add-on and Maintenance. Later, I worked as a Technical Support Representative skilled at analyzing complex customer's issues with focus on their satisfaction and good experience.</p>
      <p>My Motto is to keep improving myself and moving forward in life. In 2018 I started to learn coding to step up in my career for the field of web development. 

      </p>
      
      <p>For a personal aspect, I love Snowboarding and Bodyboarding and I used to go to the beach and the mountain during the same weekends in Japan.</p>
      <p>Anyway, I'm enjoying my life here, recently many new restaurants have opened (I love to eat!) which always make me very happy!
      For example, "JINYA RAMEN BAR" is a new place I want to go to as soon as possile!</p>
