   <p>My career started in Japan as COBOL Programmer for 3 years, then System Engineer for 4 years in SIers working on
    Oracle EBS Add-on and Maintenance. Later, I joined Oracle Japan and worked as Customer Support Technical Engineer
    for Oracle EBS (All Financial Products) for 9.5 years with skill to analyze complex customer's issues with focus on
    their satisfaction and good experience.

     2 years to do volunteer activity for Earthquake victims in Japan. (Unfortunately I needed to drop out of the school
     to accept the transfer offer. But I will continue the learning in the future)</p>
